# Communicating Data Findings : Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project
## by Jacob Bedard


## Dataset

> For this project I'm using the Prosper Loans dataset as I am interested in personal finance.  Original dataset can be downloaded from the internet [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv), as well as a guide to the variables in the dataset found [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key%3D0AllIqIyvWZdadDd5NTlqZ1pBMHlsUjdrOTZHaVBuSlE%26usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&ust=1554486256024000).


## Summary of Findings

> Exploring the data, I did find that each of my variables of interest had a correlation with my main variable of interest: borrower APR.  As expected, Prosper rating had the largest correlation with borrower APR (a negative correlation), which was not unexpected.  What I did find that was unexpected, was that APR actually increased with larger loan sizes for the two highest rating tiers, A and AA, while it decresed for the lower rating tiers. This is counter-intuitive to what one might expect in traditional financing. 

## Key Insights for Presentation

> It was in following the above finding about APRs trending upwards for the higher rating class as loan size increased that lead me to look deeper, and in so doing, I found that it was the medium and long term loans (36 and 60 month) that were the worst bargain for high-tier loan shoppers, which again is counter-intuitive to what one would expect from traditional lenders.
